HTTP for ColdFusion Developers
==============================

This project has code samples used for my HTTP for ColdFuison Developers presentation.

These samples are intended to be run with a Web debugging proxy such as Charles or ServcieCapture so that you can see the effects of various ColdFusion tags on HTTP request and response messages.
